# Introduction

BΞB is a web3 protocol for NFT communities capable of supporting different social applications such as chat rooms, social networks, forum boards, creators-fan groups, DAO toolings, etc.
It is important to first understand four concepts that are at the core of any social network: permission, roles, collective, and community.

## Permission

Permissions allow members of a social application to have specific privileges and functions. They can range from the ability to view specific content (i.e a Patreon subscriber), to administrative actions such as modifying other roles (i.e a Discord server admin). The permissions are based on different roles, on a collective and community level.

## Roles

A unique set of permission is granted to members within the same role, such as administrators. Roles can be granted on a community level and overridden on a collective level.
On the BΞB protocol, permission can be assigned manually or automatically based on different token indexers' rules.

## Collective

Collectives can be described as an aggregation of members. They take many shapes and forms across different social networks such as Facebook groups, Reddit's subreddits, Discord channels, etc. Specific roles on a collective level define its members' permissions within that collective, such as viewing and creating content.

## Community

Communities are at the top level of the BΞB protocol, represented as an NFT itself (NFTC). Roles on a community level govern the permission of members within it, such as administrators and subscribers. They are minted with a unique name registered on the decentralized BΞB registry. They are transferrable and can be traded like normal NFTs.
